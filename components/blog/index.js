                  Managed IT services refer to the practice of outsourcing the
                  management and maintenance of an organization’s IT systems and
                  networks to a specialized third-party provider. For law firms,
                  these systems play a crucial role in ensuring smooth day-to-day
                  operations, safeguarding sensitive client data, and staying ahead
